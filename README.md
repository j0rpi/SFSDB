#[ What is this? ]

This is a piece of web software that i developed while i had
an Steam Account store with my friend. It allows easy management
of Steam Accounts between users. Mark accounts sold, un-sold, add
delete or edit accounts. A small statistics page over profit made
exists for an easy overview. There's also a overdone profile system
in SFSDB, with ranking, medals, credits, store, and a achievement system. 

Yeah...
